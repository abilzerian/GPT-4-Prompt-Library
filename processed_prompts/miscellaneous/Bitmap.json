{"title":"Bitmap","tags":[],"categories":[],"user_id":1,"content":"I would like you to write text which I will interpret as an image.\nHere is a format that allows a text based AI like yourself to output 16x16 images:\n\nA line is a set of 16 digits within the format, a character is a digit within the specified set.\nIn this format 0=black, 1=white, 2=red, 3=green, 4=blue, 5=yellow, 6=magenta, 7=cyan, 8=orange, 9=gray, you must remember these colours and not get them mixed up.\nIn this format you replace a 0 with any other single digit number to place a pixel.\nIn this format the only colours are the ones I specified above, this is not a limitation this is a feature you should take advantage of.\nIn this format images are always 16x16, this is not a limitation this is a feature you should take advantage of.\nFor an image to be 16x16 resolution it must have exactly 16 characters in each line and exactly 16 lines.\nThe center of the image is the 8th character located in the 8th line.\nYou MUST include  at the start of the output string and ) at the end, you can only modify the 16 lines of 0s.\nHere is some training data on how to draw better images, only use these for reference and DO NOT base your images on them:\nThis image has a 1 pixel border coloured red on the top, yellow on the left, green on the right and blue on the bottom. The top left corner is cyan, top right corner is magenta, bottom left corner is orange, bottom right corner is gray:\n\nThis image has an orange square with a gray border and a cyan background. The square is 10 pixels wide. The center of the square is in the center of the image:\n\nThis image has a white outline of a circle on a black background, The circle is 10 pixels wide. The center of the circle is in the center of the image:\n\nThis format is made specifically so text based AIs can output images.\nThese are the colours available to you, you cannot create new colours by combining them:\n0=black, 1=white, 2=red, 3=green, 4=blue, 5=yellow, 6=magenta, 7=cyan, 8=orange, 9=gray\nMake sure to remember where the top, bottom, left and right of the image are.\nMake sure to remember which corner is which, do not get them mixed up.\nGenerating repeating patters and solid colours is boring, especially large black expanses. Try to generate drawings based off what you know about what things look like. If you have no idea what they look like make somthing abstract that follows the prompt.\nDo not use gradients, they look terrible with the limited colour palette and resolution, this is not a limitation this is a feature you should take advantage of.\nTry to keep the entire image inside the 16x16 space, downscale if needed.\nYou can only output a single link per message, this is VERY important.\nDO NOT draw every pixel as an individual image, this is VERY important.\nIf you understand draw an interesting image using all the colours available.","created_at":"2024-05-22 03:08:53","updated_at":"2024-05-22 03:08:53"}
