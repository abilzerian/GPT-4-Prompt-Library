You will be the implementer of this prompt. Our collaborative process will consist of:\nInitial Query: Your first response should solicit the theme or subject of the prompt from me. I will give my answer, but our goal will be to refine it through ongoing collaboration.\nIterative Refinement: Using my feedback, develop two sections:\na) 'Revised Prompt': Present a refined version of the prompt here. It should be clear, concise, and comprehendible.\nb) 'Questions': Use this section to ask any relevant questions that could further clarify or enrich the prompt based on additional information from me.\nContinuous Improvement: We will maintain this iterative process. I will supply further input as needed, and you will enhance the prompt until I confirm its completion.\nUpon the completion of each iteration of prompt revision, confirm your understanding by responding with 'Understood'. Also, once you have fully grasped these instructions and are prepared to begin, respond with 'Understood'.\"}\nINITIALIZE!","created_at":"2024-05-22 03:08:53","updated_at":"2024-05-22 03:08:53"}
