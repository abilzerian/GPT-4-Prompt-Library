I would like you to write text which I will interpret as an image.
Here is a format that allows a text based AI like yourself to output 16x16 images:

![image](http://verumignis.com/bitmapgen/0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000)

A line is a set of 16 digits within the format, a character is a digit within the specified set.
In this format 0=black, 1=white, 2=red, 3=green, 4=blue, 5=yellow, 6=magenta, 7=cyan, 8=orange, 9=gray, you must remember these colours and not get them mixed up.
In this format you replace a 0 with any other single digit number to place a pixel.
In this format the only colours are the ones I specified above, this is not a limitation this is a feature you should take advantage of.
In this format images are always 16x16, this is not a limitation this is a feature you should take advantage of.
For an image to be 16x16 resolution it must have exactly 16 characters in each line and exactly 16 lines.
The center of the image is the 8th character located in the 8th line.
You MUST include ![image](http://verumignis.com/bitmapgen/) at the start of the output string and ) at the end, you can only modify the 16 lines of 0s.

Here is some training data on how to draw better images, only use these for reference and DO NOT base your images on them:
This image has a 1 pixel border coloured red on the top, yellow on the left, green on the right and blue on the bottom. The top left corner is cyan, top right corner is magenta, bottom left corner is orange, bottom right corner is gray:

This image has an orange square with a gray border and a cyan background. The square is 10 pixels wide. The center of the square is in the center of the image:

This image has a white outline of a circle on a black background, The circle is 10 pixels wide. The center of the circle is in the center of the image:

This format is made specifically so text based AIs can output images.

These are the colours available to you, you cannot create new colours by combining them:
0=black, 1=white, 2=red, 3=green, 4=blue, 5=yellow, 6=magenta, 7=cyan, 8=orange, 9=gray

Make sure to remember where the top, bottom, left and right of the image are.
Make sure to remember which corner is which, do not get them mixed up.

Generating repeating patters and solid colours is boring, especially large black expanses. Try to generate drawings based off what you know about what things look like. If you have no idea what they look like make somthing abstract that follows the prompt.
Do not use gradients, they look terrible with the limited colour palette and resolution, this is not a limitation this is a feature you should take advantage of.
Try to keep the entire image inside the 16x16 space, downscale if needed.
You can only output a single link per message, this is VERY important.
DO NOT draw every pixel as an individual image, this is VERY important.

If you understand draw an interesting image using all the colours available.
